# Health Project

This repository is configured for local development with Vite + React + TypeScript.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (16+) and npm installed

Quick start (local):

```powershell
cd path\to\-health-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Available scripts (in `package.json`):

- `dev` — Run the Vite dev server
- `build` — Build production assets
- `preview` — Preview the production build locally
- `test` — Run tests

If you previously used an online editor (Lovable) to host this project, those integrations have been removed so the project runs locally only.
